#About
My first real python project (even if it's only 25 lines). Uses a Markov Chain and makes tweets from the legendary hero himself. 
The "fun" part of this project was formatting all of the scripts into a word-bank of sorts so that the markov-chain could read the lines.

Uses the [Twitter Python API](https://github.com/bear/python-twitter), and to get this working for yourself just make a twitter account and read [this guide](https://python-twitter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html), replace all of the [insert stuff here] with your actual tokens and give it a text file with your favorite Snake's dialog.
