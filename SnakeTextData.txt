  So what are you doing here then?
 What's that.
 Why?
 Sounds like Stockholm Syndrome to me.
 Wake up you idiot!  She's the one who shot Meryl!
 They're planning to launch a nuke!  I've got to stop them!
 First, you have to get me out of here!
 That guard's got the key.  You'll have to take him out!
 You have to!!
 Wait!

 I should've known you were behind this, Colonel.
 What do you want from me?
 Invited!? That's what you call sending armed soldiers after me?
 I'm retired from FOX-HOUND. You're not my commander anymore, and I
           don't have to take orders from you or anyone else.
 Who's this?
 Are you military?
 What's the shot for?
 What soldiers?
 A nuclear weapon?
 FOX-HOUND hijacking a nuclear weapon?
 Those are some heavy duty hostages.
 Questions? I haven't even said whether I'd accept this mission.
 Tell me about the nuclear weapons disposal facility.
 So someone needs to penetrate, gather intelligence, and report 
           back... Sounds like a spy movie. What's the insertion method?
 Not with this storm going on.
 Approach?
 And then?
 Launch?
 You want me to swim in sub-zero Alaskan water?
 Anyone going with me?
 Weapons and equipment OSP (on-site procurement)?
 The Chief of DARPA and the president of an arms manufacturing 
           company... what business did they have at a nuclear weapons 
           disposal facility?
 Must be extremely important exercises if those two were directly 
           involved. Were they testing some kind of new advanced weapon?
 Do we know exactly where they're being held?
 Do they really have the ability to launch a nuclear missile?
 Was the number confirmed?
 Isn't there some kind of safety device to prevent this kind of 
           terrorism?
 PAL?
 Why not?
 But even if they have a nuclear warhead, it must've been removed 
           from its missile. All the missiles on these disposal sites are 
           supposed to be dismantled. It's not that easy to get your hands on
           an ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missle).
 So what exactly are they demanding?
 Remains?
 Cell specimens? Why would they want that?
 Strengthened?
 There are genes that do that?
 Gene therapy?
 Okay, and so if you knew what genes were responsible for making 
           the perfect soldier, you could implant them in the same way, right?
 One of the greatest soldiers ever?
 You don't mean Big Boss?!
 So his body was recovered after all.
 Priceless to the military perhaps.
 You people are amazing. And then you're going to transplant those 
           genes into soldiers?
 The Sons of Big Boss.
 What's the time limit?
 Did they say what the target will be?
 When did the countdown start?
 Colonel, who are you speaking for?
 So who's in supervisory control of this operation?
 Which means that the President must be meeting with his top aides 
           in the map room about now, huh?
 If that's a real nuclear warhead, shouldn't they issue a COG 
           (Continuity of Government)?
 Well if they haven't relocated to nuclear shelter under Mount 
           Washingtion, I suppose there isn't that much reason to worry yet. 
           Is the National Security Agency in on this?
 The DIA? I'm starting to get a bad feeling about this.
 We don't need desk jockies. We need a nuclear weapons specialist.
 We need backup from a specialist. I'm just an amateur when it comes
           to nuclear weapons.
 A female analyst?
 Where's she working from?
 California. Seems like a million miles away.
 How well-armed are these terrorists? I know there was an exercise 
           going on at the time they revolted.
 What about they're battle experience.
 I wouldn't expect anything less from FOX-HOUND.
 Tell me about these Next-Generation Special Forces.
 Who's "they"?
 Looks like a pretty international group. Mercenaries?
 Outer Heaven.
 Video game players, huh?
 I thought using genetically modified soldiers was prohibited by 
           international law.
 How could an entire unit be subverted to rebellion?
 The Sons of Big Boss. But if they were regular army, they must've 
           been interviewed periodically by army counsellers.
 But they all took part in the uprising?
 Was there any sign recently that something might be wrong?
 They can do that even without you?
 So they're still around.
 Looks like a lovely bunch of folks. Too bad we'll be meeting under 
           these circumstances.
 Liquid Snake?!
 Liquid Snake.
 Tell me what you know.
 I was just a kid myself back then.
 He was a spy for the British Secret Intelligence Service?
 I thought that by the time I left they were no longer using
           codenames.
 I have a twin?
 Why don't I find that thought more comforting? 
 Colonel, I don't work for the government anymore. Let me go back to
           Twin Lakes.
 There's a dogsled race this week. Next Saturday I have to be in 
           Anchorage.
 Right now my fifty huskies are my only family. I've got to take care
           of them.
 What do you mean?
 I told you, even if I do owe you I don't anything to this army or
           this country!
 Why should I be stupid enough to do that? I'm no patriot.
 Oh I see. Blackmail.
 Why do you say that?
 You think my life is some kind of joke?
 Colonel, you're retired. Why are you involved in this?
 Is that really the only reason?
 Colonel, you're a lousy liar. Tell me the real reason. 
 Who is it?
 What was your niece doing here?
 She looks like you.
 A personal motive, Colonel. That's not very soldierly.
 Since when are we friends?
 With my personality I don't have too many friends.
 All right, but I have two conditions.
 One, no more secrets between us. I want complete disclosure at all 
           times and two, I'll only accept orders from you, Colonel. No cutoffs
           involved okay?
 What?
 I understand, Colonel.
 That doctor. Is she part of this operation too? 
 You mean you've seen them naked?
 By the way, what was that injection for?
 Nanomachines?
 Now I don't have to worry about food.
 Say what?
 It'll make smarter huh? Anything else?
 That was quite a cocktail. Anything else in there?
 I guess I can call you when I'm ready to go on a diet.
 I need to borrow your scissors.
 Don't worry. Just going to clean myself up a little.
 I don't want to be mistaken for the leader of the terrorists.
 This is Snake.  Colonel, can you hear me?
 Looks like the elevator in the back is the only way up.
 Got it, okay, I'm ready to go.
 It's Snake.  I'm in front of the disposal facility.
 I'm nice and dry, but it is a little hard to move.
 Take it easy, I'm grateful.  If it wasn't for your suit and your 
           shot I would have turned into a popsicle out there.
 I'm relieved to hear that.  Already tested, huh?  By the way, how's
           the diversionary operation going?
 A Hind D?  Colonel, what's a Russian gunship doing here?
 Who's that?
 ......
 Nothing...I just didn't expect a world-class designer of military
           technology to be so...cute.
 No, I'm serious.  Now I know I won't be bored for the next 18 hours.
 Looks like we both have a lot to learn about each other.
 Got it.  I'll call if I'm feeling lonely.
 I remember.  First I'm strip searched by Doctor Naomi here, and then
           all my weapons are taken away.  Imagine yourself put in that 
           position.
 I'll hold you to that doctor.  By the way, sorry to dissapoint you
           but I did manage to smuggle out my smokes.
 In my stomach.  Thanks to the shot you gave me that suppressed my
           stomach acids.
 You never know.
 I can't just knock on the door and ask them to let me in.  One 
           sentry on the left and one on the right.  They're armed with "five
           five sixers" and pineapples...
 I can't see it from here.
 Master?  What are you doing here?
 Passing on the skills to a new generation, huh?
 There's no one I'd rather have in a foxhole than you.
 1st floor basement ventilation shaft...
 Woman in the cell?
 There's an intruder besides me?
 Is this the first time you've ever pointed a gun at a person?  Your
           hands are shaking.
 Can you shoot me, rookie?
 Liar!  That nervous glance... that scared look in your eyes. They're
           rookie's eyes if I ever saw them.  You've never shot a person, am I
           right?
 You haven't even taken the safety off, rookie.
 You're not one of them are you?
 Why?
 Looks like we'll be a little delayed.  What are you doing!?  Don't
           think!  Shoot!
 Wait! Who are you?
 Naomi, I just had some kind of hallucination.  Is it from the 
           nanomachines?
 So what was it?
 So that was Mantis...?
 Am I too late?
 He's alive.  You're the ArmsTech president Kenneth Baker, right?
           Don't worry, I'm here to save you.
 C4!
 And you?
 Who are you!?
 Who the hell!?
 Can you talk?
 I'm not one of them.  The DARPA Chief told me he gave them his
           detonation code.  What about yours?
 Answer my question!  What about your code!?  There's no time!
 What! Now the terrorists have both codes and can launch anytime!
 He couldn't read you?  How'd you do it?
 Surgical implants?
 Even the DARPA Chief?
 But the DARPA Chief said Mantis got his code by reading his mind.
 Yeah, I'm sure.  In that case, how did they get your code?
 It looks like he had some fun with you all right.
 What happened to your arm?
 Looks like you're more than even now.  His was sliced off.
 Dead.
 Calm down!  What's wrong with you?  I just told you I was here to
           save you!  I didn't kill the DARPA Chief.  He had a heart attack or
           something.
 Anyway, the terrorists have both codes now.
 I agree.  But what do they really want?
 Well I'm not going to let these maniacs start a war toady.  Do you
           still have the card keys.
 To override tge detonation codes!  I heard you had them...
 What!?  Who does then!?  Not the terrorists!?
 Woman!?  Who!?
 A female soldier?  It must be...
 A new recruit?  Could that be the Colonel's niece!?
 I'm sure she is.  She's green... but as tough as they come.  But
           how did you know she escaped?
 Codec?
 I'm sure she still has it.  What frequency was she at?
 Huh?
 Damn!
 I'll contact her right away.  But tell me... If this doesn't work,
           is there some other way to prevent the missile launch?
 Who's that?
 What if he can't come up with anything?
 Where is this Emmerich?
 I understand, but... why Metal Gear?  The Nuclear Age ended with the
           turn of the millenium.
 ...No.
 So they just close the lid and pretend like it'll go away?
 Unbelievable.
 MUF?
 What about the other superpowers?
 You mean Metal Gear.
 I remember hearing a lot about mergers and take-overs among the
           big weapons makers.
 Black project?
 Bribes.
 I don't give a crap about you and your company.
 What's that?
 What kind of data?
 Can you walk?
 I have one more question.  Who or what was that ninja thing?  It
           looked like you knew something.
 Dark little secret?
 You know him?
 Naomi?
 What?  Doesn't Metal Gear use currently existing technology?
 Huh!?
 What are you talking about!?
 What the hell?
 Colonel!  Are you listening?  Now he's dead too!
 Don't lie to me!
 Some kind of poison!?  
 Damn!
 Can I trust her?
 ......
 Naomi, what the hell was that ninja thing?
 A member of FOX-HOUND?
 Are you sure?
 Is that right?
 I was really impressed with the way you busted yourself out of
           there.
 You're the Colonel's niece, Meryl, right?
 I'm the fool that your uncle sent all alone into the middle of this
           whole mess.
 I appreciate your help from before.  But... I don't need lectures.
           You're just like your uncle, you know.
 We go way back.
 My name's not important.
 That's what some people called me.
 But I knew you were.
 It's your eyes.
 They're not soldiers eyes.
 No, they're beautiful compassionate eyes.
 Don't worry.  You'll land back on them once you meet me.  The 
           reality is no match for the legend, I'm afraid.
 Why did you look surprised when you saw my face?
 ...You mean the terrorists leader, Liquid Snake?
 I have no family.
 Who knows.  Why don't you ask him?  But first I want some 
           information.  You were involved in this excercise from the
           beginning. What exactly happened here?
 That's okay.  But what is this place?  I don't think it is just a
           nuclear wepaons disposal facility...
 This is a civilian base?
 Colonel!
 Why FOX-HOUND?
 But we must have fired nuclear warheads before.  Why just this time?
 Hmmm... sounds kind of fishy...  So what do you think the terrorists
           want?
 Oh yeah, that's when he gave you the detonation override keys, 
           right?
 Amazing you were able to keep 'em hidden from the guards.
 He's dead...
 Heart attack.  Same as the DARPA Chief.
 Yeah, was either of them sick or anything?
 Well, I don't believe in coincidences.  Something funny's going on.
 Me neither... yet.  Do you know the person who designed Metal Gear?
 Yes.  Is he still alive?
 Second floor basement?
 So they'll need him alive until that's done anyway.
 You're right.  In case we can't override the detonation code in time, I 
           need to ask him how to destroy Metal Gear.
 It won't be the first time...
 What's the best way to get to the building where the Doctor is being
           held?
 What's the security level of the door there?
 Well, I've got to go save the Doctor.  You should go...
 No way!  You're still too green.  I want you to hide somewhere.
 Oh yes you are.
 You pause for just one second in front of your enemy and it's 
           all over!  Good luck doesn't last forever!
 Shooting at targets and shooting at living, breathing people
           are different.
 So what now?  You wanna quit?
 Listen, Meryl.  Everybody feels sick the first time they kill 
           someone.  Unfortunately, killing is one of those things that gets
           easier the more you do it.  In a war, all of mankind's worst emotions,
           worst traits come out. It's easy to forget what a sin is in the middle
           of a battlefield.
 You're just a little jumpy from the combat high.  The adrenaline
           in your blood is starting to whin out.  Just take it easy.
 We'll talk about it later.  For now, just think about keeping
           yourself alive.
 Okay, let me try to say this another way... Stay the hell out of my way.
 Ha ha, I told you.  The real me is no match for the legend.
 We'll link up after I grab the Doctor.  Then we'll take care of the 
           detonation code override.
 Be careful, okay?
 Thanks.  Where are you?
 Don't move around too much.
 You won't be for long with the way you walk.
 Oh... nothing.
 Gas...
 Wait!  You said you'd stay put and be a good girl!
 Don't get careless.  That is when things always turn sour.
 These guys are proffesionals.  You're gonna get yourself killed.
 What?  What are you talking about?
 Yeah.  There's lots of boxes piled up here, but... are they all
           warheads?
 They just leave them here?  It's like President Baker said...
           totally careless.
 It looks like they were cut by some type of blade.
 Grey Fox... Colonel, that ninja is Grey Fox.  No doubt about it.
 And where is he now?
 And what about this soldier?
 And that was Grey Fox...
 Naomi, why didn't you tell us about this sooner?
 Is that the only reason?
 From what I could tell, he didn't know who he was.
 I'm not sure, but he seems intent on fighting me to the death.
           We'll meet again, I know it.
 Hmmmmm... I'd rather not, but maybe that's what he wants...
 Master?
 Colonel, is Naomi there?
 Yeah.  Go on, Master...
 ...I don't want to believe it either.  But she is working for
           FOX-HOUND.
 What do you mean!?
 I knew it.  You're hiding something.
 I don't have any time left for you.
 What's wrong?  Did you find a good place to hide?
 How do you know that?
 Right in front of Metal Gear... but it's strange.
 There's nobody here... no guards, nobody patrolling... it's too
           quiet.
 What should I do?
 But I've only got one of the three keys.  And besides that, like
           Ocelot said, there's some trick to using the keys...
 You got some kind of plan?
 Baker's files?  Don't you need a password?
 Are you a hacker?
 Does it look like you can get in?
 I'm counting on you...
 How's it going?
 Do you think you'll break in soon?
 Okay, keep trying.
 You got past security?
 Great.  So whaddya got?
 So what about the PAL override system that Baker talked about?
 That's what I need to know!
 What?
 Pretty sneaky.
 I can't wait to hear this.
 You mean it won't show up on radar?
 Why weren't they able to develope one until now?
 Oh yeah, that makes sense.
 An invisible nuclear warhead...
 We learned that lesson in the Gulf War.
 It's the ultimate weapon.  And from a political point of view, it
           avoids the problem of nuclear reduction and nuclear inspections.
           Colonel, is this true?  Are you listening?
 If word of this got out, it could delay the signing of the Start 3
           Treaty and cause a huge international incident.
 Did you know this, Colonel?
 You've changed, Colonel.
 You mean they ran a computer model?
 What were the results of the excercise?
 It was.  President Baker gave me an optical disc with all of the
           test data.
 No, Ocelot took it from me.
 So you think they can do it?
 Did you find out how to override it yet?
 We're counting on you...
 Liquid!
 One billion dollars! 
 Big Boss's dream...
 Meryl... she's alive.
 Great job.
 They've finished inputting the PAL codes. So how do we deactivate
           them?
 Only once, huh.
 But it takes three keys, right!? I've only got one of them!
 What are you talking about!?
 Shape memory alloy?
 This card key?
 So this key is actually three keys in one...clever.
 I see them.
 Okay, I got it. First I change the shape of the card and then I
           input them in order, right?
 Damn!! The key fell in the drainage ditch!
 Okay, that takes care of PAL code number one... Now PAL number
           two... freeze the key.
 Then you should talk to the Colonel. He's looking into it.
 Okay it's off. No one else can hear us. Go ahead.
 Okay, so what's up?
 Yeah...
 An assassination weapon?
 No...
 ...Liquid and others were talking about it...
 What are you trying to say?
 What is!?
 Yeah...?
 No... You're telling me that Naomi was behind it?
 ...The nanomachines.
 ...Does the Colonel know?
 Okay. I'll ask him myself. Colonel, what's new with the Naomi
           situation?
 Arrest?
 Are you sure?
 What kind of interrogation?
 Call me if you find out anything.
 Naomi...I can't believe it.
 Listen. I've got bigger things to worry about.
 All I can do is leave it up to the Colonel.
 Naomi!? ...what the hell!?
 Naomi, is what the Colonel says true?
 Cause you want to know yourself, right?
 Naomi...
 Rhodesia? What's now known as Zimbabwe?
 Naomi, you're too worried about the past. Isn't it enough to
           understand who you are now?
 Your big brother?
 What!?
 Gray Fox?
 And he brought you back to America?
 Who is "he" ? ...You mean Big Boss?
 So were your prayers answered?
 To kill me?  Is that all you cared about?
 Do you still hate me?
 What about Liquid and the others?
 Naomi...you didn't kill that doctor too, did you?  The one that
           used Gray Fox for his genome experiments...
 So that Ninja...I mean Gray Fox... he's come here to kill me?
 ...Fox...no... Naomi, tell me something...
 Those enzymes recognize the target's DNA?
 And then...they cause a heart attack?
 Apoptosis...you mean the heart cells commit suicide... Naomi...
 ...You must have programmed that thing to kill me too, right? Do I
           still have time? Naomi, I don't blame you for wanting me dead.  But
           I can't go yet. I still have a job to do.
 You weren't?
 What happened to Naomi!? What did she mean when she said that
           FoxDie was a part of this operation!?  Colonel, let me talk to her! 
 ...you double crossed me!
 Okay, there goes PAL code number two. Next comes PAL number
           three... warm the key.
 No! Why!
 Master, what's going on?
 What do you mean?
 You mean you had this planned from the beginning? Just to get me to
           input the detonation code!?
 Who the hell are you!?
 Ace-in-the-hole?
 Who are you anyway!?
 Where are you?
 So who is it?
 Liquid!? How the...!?
 Liquid!!
 Why did you disguise yourself as Master?
 What the hell are you talking about!?
 What?
 A diversion?
 You don't mean...
 Fox Die! ...It can't be! Are you telling me Naomi was working with
           the Pentagon?
 What?
 I wonder... maybe they arrested her so they could find out the
           answer to that. 
 There's a vaccine?
 Why is that? 
 A bug in the virus' programming?
 So it's true...you and I are...
 I was the favorite, huh.
 ...So that's why you're so obsessed with Big Boss. Some warped
           kind of love.
 You're just like Naomi.
 Damn!!
  It's moving... 
 How do I stop it?
 Did that do it!? Damn!!!
 Gray Fox!!
 So it is you!?
 Fox, why!? What do you want from me!?
 Fox, stay out of this... What about Naomi? She's hell bent on
           taking revenge for you.
 You're the only one who can stop her.
 Why?
 Fox...
 Fox!
 Fox! 
 He destroyed the radome...
 Fox!
 Fooooooox!!!
 Ooooh! Uuuuff!
 Liquid... you're still alive...
 Too bad. It looks like your revolution was a failure.
 Fighting? What are you really after?
 That was Big Boss's fantasy.
 But as long as there are people, there will always be war.
 Is that the only reason?
 I don't want that kind of world!
 ......
 What!
 That was...
 You're wrong!
 Created?
 Big Boss...
 Super Baby Method?
 Octuplets...
 .......
 What?
 The Genome Soldiers!?
 Sacrifices?
 Hah. Everyone knows that the Gulf War Syndrome was caused by
           exposure to depleted uranium used in anti-tank rounds.
 So then... the so called Gulf War Babies that have been reported
           by Gulf War veterans are...
 So the Genome Soldiers mean that the experiments were a success?
 What!?
  !!!
 You want Big Boss's DNA so you can save your family? It's very 
           touching.
 You're telling me that your genes are ordering you to save the
           Genome Soldiers?
 Meryl!? Is she alive?
 Meryl...
 I have a name!
 Let Meryl go!
 ...You're talking about FoxDie?
 Colonel! Can you hear me?
 What is the Pentagon trying to do!? Colonel! Colonel! Answer me!
 What for?
 What!?
 What?! Metal Gear is destroyed. Tell the Secretary of Defense!
 He's going to drop a nuclear bomb to vaporize all the evidence
           along with anyone who knows anything...
 How?
 But Colonel, if you do that...
 Those bastards...
 Are you sure? ...It'll be bad for you.
 Colonel...
 Mei Ling, what happened to the Colonel!?
 What happened!?
 Put the Colonel back on!
 Ridiculous!
 You bastard...!
 The President ordered this?
 How do you plan on explaining a nuclear attack on Alaska to the
           media?
 ...Smart. You'll be murdering everyone here. The scientists, the
           Genome Army, everyone...
 So you didn't mean to kill the DARPA Chief after all?
 And you could care less about what happens to everybody else, huh?
 What are you talking about?
 I don't have it.
 Meryl?  ....Meryl?   Meeeeryyyyylll!
 Forgive me.  Damn!  I gave into my fear.  I gave into my pain.  I
           sold your life to save my oen...  I'm a loser.  I'm not the hero
           you thought I was.  I'm nothing!  Meryl, I'm sorry!  Forgive me.
 Otacon?
 ...Because of me....
 What the hell do you know?  Meryl's dead.  I lost.
 Together forever?
 Otacon... you've changed.
 Okay.  Let's go!  Meryl, I hope you're still watching me.  Maybe I
           can prove myself to you after all.
 C'mon, hustle!
 My sneaking suit!
 Otacon, are you okay?
 Otacon, can you move?
 What happened to Liquid?
 Liquid is dead... Uh oh!
 If he's dead, that means....
 What happened to the air raid? No stealth bombers in sight.
 Colonel!
 Colonel, what happened?
 Arrested?
 Acting alone? What happened to the air raid and the nuclear strike?
 I see... 
 I wonder about that. 
 Colonel, about Meryl...
 ..... Colonel
 What!?
 Colonel, I....
 It's okay, Colonel.
 Oh that's right.
 Me neither. I better not show my face around here.
 That's not too far from the truth. 
 Okay, Roy. Are you going to be okay?
 The battery on these nanomachines will run out soon. They won't be
           able to follow us.
 Don't worry. I'll pay you a visit sometime.
 Roy, just tell me one thing.
 About Fox Die.
 What about me? It killed Liquid...
 How is she?
 Naomi...
 I'm sorry... but he had one last message he wanted to say to you.
           He told me to tell you to forget about him and to go on with your
           own life.
 Yeah. He also said he'll always love you... Naomi, your brother
           just saved you, me and the whole world. He fought with every ounce
           of strength in his body.
 Naomi, Liquid died from Fox Die too. What about me? When am I
           gonna go?
 What do you mean?
 Yeah, so when's mine up?
 ..........
 Until today, I've lived only for myself.  Survival has been the
           only thing I cared about in my life.
 I only felt truly alive when I was staring Death in the face.  I
           don't know, maybe it's written into my genes.
 I want to enjoy life.  I really do.  How about you, Otacon?
 So what are you going to do?  Continue your research?
 Sounds good...
 You and I are more alike than I thought...
 You're giving up your stealth camo?
 No thanks.  I'd rather do it myself.
 My real name is David, Otacon.
 Oh, that's right... Hal.  Hal and Dave?  That's a good one.  Ha ha
           ha ha ha... Maybe we should take a trip to Jupiter...
 Hmmm. I think it's time for me to look for a new path in life.
 A new purpose.
 I'll find it.  I know I'll find it.
 Meryl? Meryl!?
 Meryl? Meryl, are you okay?
 Meryl, it must have been terrible...
 Torture?
 You're a strong woman.
 ...I'm sorry.
 Otacon, good news! Meryl's okay.
 I got some bad news too. We're about to be bombed.
 Is there a way out of here?
 The door in front?
 How about the security?
 What are you going to do?
 Are you crazy!
 But...
 Otacon?
 Otacon, this is a hardened shelter, but they're going to use a
           surface piercing nuclear bomb. It won't hold.
 ........
 Good. Don't die on me.
 I will... 
 Thanks.
 ...I believe in you.
 Let's get the hell out of here.
 He's... He's... fighting right now... With his old self... to be
           the man he wants to be.
 Yeah, and I don't want it to be in vain.
 Meryl.
 Meryl. It's started...
 It looks like we're not gonna have a love scene after all.
 Let's get out of here! 
 There's my Sneaking Suit!
 Meryl, are you okay?
 Meryl, can you move?
 What happened to Liquid?
 Liquid is dead... Uh oh!
 Die... If he's dead, that means...
 What happened to the air raid? No Stealth bombers in sight.
 Colonel!
 Colonel, what happened?
 Arrested?
 Acting alone? What happened to the air raid and the nuclear strike?
 I see... 
 I wonder about that. 
 Colonel, you can rest easy. Meryl's fine.
 It's okay, Colonel.
 Oh that's right.
 Me neither. I better not show my face around here.
 That's not too far from the truth. 
 Dr. Hal Emmerich should be somewhere on the base. I want someone
           to bring him in.
 Okay, Roy. Are you going to be okay?
 The battery on these nanomachines will run out soon. They won't be
           able to follow us.
 Don't worry. I'll pay you a visit sometime.
 Roy, just tell me one thing.
 About Fox Die.
 What about me? It killed Liquid...
 How is she?
 Naomi...
 I'm sorry... but he had one last message he wanted to say to you.
           He told me to tell you to forget about him and to go on with your
           own life.
 Yeah. He also said he'll always love you... Naomi, your brother
           just saved you, me and the whole world. He fought with every ounce
           of strength in his body.
 Naomi, Liquid died from Fox Die too. What about me? When am I
           gonna go?
 What do you mean?
 Yeah, so when's mine up?
 ..........
 Let's keep it. As a reminder.
 A reminder of how to live. Until today, I've lived only for myself.
           Survival has been the only thing I cared about in my life.
 I only felt truly alive when I was staring Death in the face. I
           don't know, maybe it's written into my genes.
 Maybe it's time I live for someone else.
 Yeah. Someone like you... Maybe that's the real way to live.
 David. My name is David...
 Hmmm. I think it's time we look for a new path in life.
 A new purpose.
 We'll find it. I know we'll find it.
 Caribou. To the Aleutians, the Caribou is a symbol of life. It'll
           be spring here soon...
 Yeah. Spring brings new life to everything. It's a time for hope.
           I've lived here a long time... But Alaska has never looked more
           beautiful. The sky... the sea... the caribou... and most of all...
           You...
 C'mon. Let's enjoy life...

 You're that ninja.
 Who are you?
 What do you want?
 What is it? Revenge?
 I need that man.  Keep your hands off him.
 It can't be!  You were killed in Zanzibar...
 What!?  Not again!!
 What's happening?
 How long are you going to stay in there?
 No, I'm not.  I always work alone.
 C'mon, get out.  We can't stay here forver.
 You're the Metal Gear shief engineer, Hal Emmerich, right?
 I heard about you from Meryl.
 Sorry, but no.  There's something that I've got to do first.
 Huh?  Are you hurt?
 Well, if that's all, it's nothing to worry about. I want to ask
            you something.  I need information about Metal Gear.
 Yeah.  What's Metal Gear really designed for?
 Liar!  I already know that Metal Gear is nothing more than a 
            nuclear-equipped, walking death mobile.
 The terrorists are planning to use Metal Gear to launch a 
            nuclear missile. You telling me I didn't know?
 Wrong.  From the beginning, the purpose of this exercise was to 
            test Metal Gear's nuclear launch capability using a dummy nuclear 
            warhead.  The terrorists are just continuing the work you started.
 I heard it directly from your boss, Baker.
 ...So you really didn't know?
 President Baker?
 A rail gun you said?
 Metal Gear's main funtion is to launch nuclear missiles.  You're
            sure you're not forgetting something?
 Yeah, but that's not all I think.  If Metal Gear fired only
            standard nuclear missiles, then they should already have all the
            practical data they need.
 So they developed a new type of nuclear weapon in a VR testing lab, 
            huh?
 So this exercise was designed to test the real thing?
 The day of the Hiroshima bomb... God's got a sense of humour all
            right.
 That's enough crying.  Pull yourself together!  Where is Metal
            Gear?  Where on this base are they keeping it?
 Where is that?
 The emergency override system for the detonation code is there
            too?
 Meryl's got the detonation override keys.  We'll link up with her.
 On that leg of yours?  You'll just slow me down.
 I don't need you.  I just need your brain.
 If you get a chance, try to escape.  When the coast is clear I'll
            try to contact you by Codec.
 Okay.
 I want you to hide somewhere and keep me informed.  You know this 
            place well, don't you?
 Good.  But I want Meryl to watch after you too.
 Meryl, the engineer's okay.
 I want you to look after him.  Where are you now?
 Meryl!  What happened!?
 Something's wrong.
 What did she look like?
 A disguise?
 You were really looking.
 Way of walking, huh?
 Where's that?
 You're not in pain, are you?
 You feel okay?  Nothing bothering you?
 Oh nothing.... I'm glad you're okay.
 I'm a little nervous.  Everyone else I've saved suddenly dies.
 Forget it, Doctor.
 Otacon?
 And Japanese cartoons played some part in that?
 That's what all scientists say.
 Just sounds like a childish excuse to me.
 Whatever.  All I want from you is information.
 You're Meryl?  There's no way you could pass for a man for long.
 I had no idea you were so feminine.
 Same smart mouth.  You're Meryl all right.  Are you hurt?
 So why'd you change?  You'd be better off dressed like one of them.
 What's that mark?
 There are no heroes in war.  All the heroes I know are either
            dead... or in prison.  One or the other.
 I'm just a man who's good at what he does.  Killing.  There's no 
            winning or losing for a mercenary.  The only winners in war are
            the people.
 I've never fought for anyone but myself. I've got no purpose in
            life.  No ultimate goal.
 It's only when I'm cheating death on the battlefield.  The only
            time I feel truly alive.
 Why didn't you contact me?
 Is that all?
 I never forget a lady.
 Yeah, you've got a great butt.
 On the battlefield you never think about what's next.
 No progress.
 Somebody's got to prevent them from launching a nuclear missile.
 ...we override the detonation code.  You got the card keys from
            Baker?
 Where are the others?  There should be three keys.
 Where could the other two be?
 Metal Gear is in an underground maintenance base to the north.
 You'll just slow me down.  You don't have enough battle experience.
 And what if you do?
 I don't like to waste bullets.
 You wanted to follow in your father's footsteps?
 So are you a soldier yet?
 Take a good look.  You won't get anothert chance for a while. You
            should wash your face while you're at it.  This isn't a training
            exercise.  Our lives are riding on this.  There are no heroes or
            heroins.  If you lose, you're worm food.
 Is that FAMAS functional?
 Where'd ya' get that Desert Eagle?
 Hmmm.  So I got a leftover, huh.  Isn't that gun a little big for
            a girl.
 C'mon.  Use my .45.
 Looks like he must have been guarding someplace important.
 What happened to the music?
 What's wrong?
 Are you okay?  What happened?
 What the!?
 What's wrong?
 Who's that!?
 Optic camouflage, huh?  I hope that's not your only trick.
 Meryl.
 Stop! Meryl!!
 Colonel, your niece is going to be okay.
 Now that Mantis is beaten, Meryl's brainwashing is going to wear
            off, right Naomi?
 I don't want to see any woman die right in front of me.
 It's okay, Colonel... she's right.
 A strong man doesn't need to read the future.  He makes his own.
 Why are you telling me this?
 Are you saying you burned your village down to bury your past?
 Let him talk.  He doesn't have much time left.
 Meryl's?
 A large place?
 What is it?
 Okay.
 Let's go, Meryl.
 Meryl?
 If you're going to doubt yourself, I'll leave you here.
 Never doubt yourself.  Just let it make you stronger.  Learn
            something from it.
 What!?
 What?  What's the problem now?
 Name means nothing on the battlfield.
 OLd enough to know what death looks like.
 No, but I was raised by many people.
 I've never been interested in anyone else's life...
 Other people just complicate my life.  I don't like to get
            involved.
 C'mon... let's go.
 The radar isn't working.  And since we can't use the mine
            detector either...
 How did you know where the mines were?
 Well... a little bit.
 Meryl!!
 Meryl, get down!!!
 Meryl!!
 Meryl...
 Don't worry, Meryl.  It's me they want.
 Damn!!
 No!
 Don't move!
 Quiet down!  Save your strength!
 Sniper's usually work in pairs, but this one's alone, huh?
 Maybe so, but Meryl can't hold out that long...
 There's no where to hide between here and the tower... she must be
            on the second floor of the tower.
 Colonel!  Take it easy.
 I'm going to save Meryl no matter what it takes.
 What's wrong, Naomi?
 Trying to say that I'm only interested in saving my own skin?
 I don't know what the hell my genes look like and I don't care. I
            operate on instinct.
 I'm going to save Meryl.  I don't need an excuse.
 And I'm not doing it for someone else either.  I'm going to save
            Meryl by myself.  Colonel, don't worry!
 A lady sniper, huh?
 I'll die after I kill you.
 Uuuuhh!!
 Meryl...
 Not bad.  I caught a nice nap on this revolving bed of yours.  Too
            bad I was sleeping alone.
 Where are my things?
 So, Metal Gear is armed with a new type of nuclear warhead, huh?
 The Colonel?
 What if I did?
 What do you mean?
 Is Meryl okay?
 Hell if I know.
 Looks like I've got a roommate.  The DARPA Chief!?  Whew...what a 
            stench!
 I've been better.
 ........
 C'mon, Colonel.  Why don't you stop playing dumb?  I'm sorry about
            Meryl but I want the lies to end now.
 Metal Gear was designed to launch a new type of nuclear warhead,
            wasn't it?
 You knew it all along, didn't you?
 Why did you try to hide it?
 Can't tell the grunts, huh?  ...You've changed a lot.  Metal
            Gear... secret advanced nuclear weapons research...  Does the
            White House know about this?  How deep does it go?
 "Need to know basis", is that the idea?
 Plausible deniability, huh?
 I get it.  That's the reason for the deadline.
 So patriotism is your excuse for circumventing the Constitution?
 Why should I?
 In that case, tell me the truth about this new type of nuclear
            warhead.
 I don't believe you.If the situation is so serious, why don't you
            give in to their demands?  Let them have Big Boss's remains.
 Or is there some reason that you can't do that?  Something you
            haven't told me about?
 And that's the only reason?
 Huh!  The hell with you!
 The corpse of the DARPA Chief is lying right here next to me.
 But it's strange.  He looks and smells like he's been dead for
            days. All his blood's been drained out too.
 I have no idea.
 Right.  But he's already started to decompose.
 SOmething in his blood that they wanted?
 I'm afraid so.  It looks like they've got both codes and are
            nearly ready to launch.
 It seems there's some type of emergency override device that can
            cancel out the detonation code.  It's a countermeasure that
            ArmsTech installed secretly.  You have to unlock it with three
            special card keys.
 I've got one of them.  I don't know where the other two are.
            Besides, I'm locked up here.
 .......  Naomi, please talk to me.  Say something to take my mind
            off the pain.
 Anything.
 Please... tell me about yourself.
 Any family?
 I don't have any family.  No wait, there was a man who said he was
            my father...
 Dead.  By my own hand.
 That's what he said.  That's all I know.
 Yup.
 He wanted it.  Besides, some people just need killing...
 Yup.  That's the trauma that Mantis was talking about.  The one
            we share in common.
 Let's just say that I needed to be alone for a while and Alaska
            was the perfect place...
 Where is he?
 I'm sorry.
 After you've been through as many wars as me, it's hard to trust anyone.
 Roy Campbell...
 No, there was another... Frank Jaeger.
 I learned a lot from him.
 That's true.  We did.  In Zanzibar.  But it was nothing personal.
            We were just proffesionals on opposite sides, that's all.
 Hard to believe?  War is no reason to end a friendship.
 
Naomi     : That's insane.
 I first met him on the battlefield.  He was being held a prisoner
            of Outer Heaven.  But he didn't look like a prisoner to me.  He
            was always so cool and precise.  I was still green and he showed
            me the ropes.
 No.  We never talked about our personal lives.  Sort of an
            unwritten rule.  The nest time I saw him on the battlefield, we
            were enemies.  We were fighting barehanded in a minefield.  I know
            it sounds strange to most people.  But we were just two soldiers
            doing our jobs.  It's like a sport.
 You're right.  We are animals.
 I don't know.
 You really like talking about genes, Naomi.  Why did you get into
            genetic research anyway?
 So you studied about DNA?
 Memory is stored in DNA?
 So what about my fate? You know my DNA sequence, don't you?
 Of course not.  You're a scientist, not a fortune-teller.
 Otacon, are you still okay?
 I have a favor to ask.  I need your help.
 I've been captured.  I'm locked up here in this cell.
 There's a big torture machine nearby.
 Thanks.
 Where?
 Otacon!
 Hurry!  Get me out of here!
 Hurry up!
 Because of him.
 If you don't hurry up and get me out of here, I'll be laying next
            to him.
 Meryl...
 Don't worry, Meryl.  It's me they want.
 Damn!!
 No!
 Don't move!
 Quiet down!  Save your strength!
 Colonel, I'm sorry...
 I wasn't able to protect her.
 Colonel...
 No.  You're wrong.
 Meryl thought she had to become a soldier... thought it was the
            only way.  She said she thought it woul;d bring her closer to her
            dead father.
 She wasn't ready for real combat.  I shouldn't have pushed her so
            hard.... It's all my fault.
 Master...
 Mei Ling...
 You're right.  Meryl would say the same thing.
 What?
 Yes, she's special.  There aren't many women like her around.
 She's the Colonel's niece... and a combat buddy.
 This is like a police interrogation.
 The genes?  What are you talking about, Colonel?
 Is that right?
 Damn!
 Liquid?
 It's a long way down. If only I had a rope.  I should be able to
            use that rope I got...
 If I stay here, I'm finished.
 Otacon? How'd you get here?
 You were watching?
 How did you get up here?
 The 1st floor of the circular staircase was destroyed.
 The elevator was working?
 No...you're wrong.  In the movies, the hero always saves the girl...
 That's what you came to ask?
 What are you trying to say?
 Yeah...I do.  I think at any time, any place... people can fall in
            love with each other.  But... if you love someone, you have to be
            able to protect them...
 I have a favor to ask.
 Don't worry. It'll be easy.
 I don't want you to either.
 The elevator is stopped down there. I want you to get it to move.
            You see? 
 It was working before, but now it isn't.
 Can you fix it?
 I've got to go and swat a noisy fly.
 You really look like hell. Are you okay?
 Strange logic. I'm counting on you.
 Why are you calling me brother?  Who the hell are you!?
 What!?
 See you in hell...Liquid.  That takes care of the cremation.
 You fixed it?
 Is that so? Okay.
 Oh, I had to take out that helicopter.
 Listen. I just want to make sure again.  This is the way to get to
            where Metal Gear is being stored?
 Okay. Find a safe place to hide out for a while.  I'm going
            underground.
 And stay outta my way. Don't try to be a hero or anything.
 What?
 Yeah, so?
 Hey. This isn't first grade math class.
 Yeah?
 .........?
 When you were riding on it, did the weight limit warning go off?
 How much do you weigh?
 It would take at least five people to go over that limit...
 Otacon! Were there any other stealth prototypes?
 So...this isn't stealth camouflage then...
 Someone's aiming at me... in the middle of this blizzard...
  Wolf? ...Sniper Wolf?
 Otacon... You sound like you're happy.
 So then what is it?
 Are you insane!?
 Listen to me, kid. She's a merciless killer.
 You're pretty good if you can hit me in this storm.
 It's a mistake for a sniper to reveal her location.
 Now I'm gonna pay you back for Meryl...
 A Kurd? So that's why you're called Wolf...
 Saladin? ...You mean Big Boss?
 Wolves are noble animals.  They're not like dogs. In Yupik, the
            word for wolf is "Kegluneq", and the Aleuts revere them as
            honorable cousins. They call mercenaries like us "Dogs of War".
            It's true, we're all for sale at some price or another. But you're
            different. ...untamed... solitary.  You're no dog... You're a
            wolf.
 Wolf... you spared Meryl's life.
 Rest easy.  You'll die as the proud wolf you are.
 What is it?
 Returning it to it's owner.  I don't need a hankercheif.
 I don't have any more tears to shed.
 I'm going to the underground base.  We're out of time.
 You'll have to protect yourself now.  Don't trust anyone.
 If I can't stop Metal Gear, this whoe place will probably be
            bombed to hell.
 We might not meet again.
 You can leave any time.  Get a headstart... a headstart on your
            new life.
 If we make it through this, I'll tell you.
 What about her?
 Don't worry.  The monitor's off.
 What's up?
 I didn't know that.  What's your point?
 Yeah?
 Yeah, what about it?
 What did you say?
 She lied?
 Rediculous!
 Yeah...
 But...
 Are you saying that Naomi might be behind it?
 Could it be...?
 You were the one in the M1 tank?  Must have been a tight fit for
            a big boy like you.
 Am I hallucinating?
 I... I can't move...
 I don't have any crows in my family tree.
 Yeah, I know it.  You must be a real threat in the "Muk-Tuk"
            eating contest.
 You want to pull each other's ears?
 This isn't glorious.  It's just plain killing.  Violence isn't a
            sport!
 Why?
 The Angel of Death?  But why go to so much trouble?  Why
            impersonate the Chief?
 What are you trying to say?

 Uuufff!!  Damn!!
 Who are you?
 Deepthroat?  The informant from the Watergate scandal?
 You're not using burst transmission.  Are you nearby?
 Who are you anyway?
 But how?  I can't reach it.

 I'm here to save you.  You're the DARPA Chief, Donald Anderson,
              right?
 I'm the pawn they sent here to save your worthless butt.
 Slow down.  Don't worry.  First I want some information... about
              the terrorists.
 Do they really have the ability to launch a nuke?
 The terrorists are threatening the White House.  They say if they
              don't accede to their demands they'll launch a nuclear weapon.
 Is it possible?!
 How do they plan to launch?  I though this place was just for
              keeping the dismantled warheads.  THey shouldn't have access to
              a missile...
 What?
 Metal Gear!?  It can't be!
 We've had a couple of run-ins in the past.  So that's the reason
              you were here at this disposal site?
 I had heard the Metal Gear project was scrapped.
 Revolution... ?
 Rex?
 But I thought that all nuclear watheads were equipped with safety
              measures.  Some kind of detonation code that you have to input.
 There are two passwords?
 Baker?  The president of ArmsTech?
 You talked?
 Psycho Mantis?
 ...This is bad...
 If they find out Baker's password...
 What?
 And if I do that?
 So where are the keys?
 Okay three card keys.  Do you know where they mught be keeping
              Baker?
 2nd floor basement?
 Any other clues?
 Personal Area Network, huh?
 And the doors will open automatically, gotcha.  OK.  I'm going to
              get you out of here.
 What is it?
 No.
 I just said no.
 That's their problem.  It has nothing to do with my orders.
 Pentagon?
 What is it!?
 Hmmmm...
 Naomi!  The chief! What happened?
 ...Colonel, are you hiding something from me?
 You want me to believe that you are in charge of this op, but 
              you don't have access to the complete file!?
 ........


PMCs...Private Military Companies.
 Every age has its mercenary. These PMCs are nothing new -
                   we've been dealing with them since before the turn of the
                   century.
 ArmsTech? You mean AT Corp?
 So, they've finally achieved total real-time battlefield
                   control?
 A cleaner, safer battlefield. Makes for nice propaganda.
 Sixty percent...
 I thought it was the U.N. that authorized the PMCs in the
                   first place.
 War orphans. Child soldiers.
 Mercenaries spun off from state armies, unmanned weapons,
                   child soldiers... Proxy battles in a new Cold War.
 "Outer Heaven?" You mean...!
 Liquid...
 I watched him die.
 The one world in which soldiers will always have a place...
 ...Killing him? You want Liquid dead. Isn't that right,
                   Colonel?
 Why me?
 Iron Mountain's "Delphi technique"...
 Sounds pretty self-serving to me.
 Fine. Let's hear it.
 What about the rebels?
 Rat Patrol, huh. They sound sneaky.
 CID (Criminal Investigation Command)... The real rats of the
                   Army.
 Friends of yours?
 I'm not like the PMCs. I don't need your money.
 But if you're going to spark something, spark this.
 Fine. I'll start my own fire.
 War has changed. It's no longer about nations, ideologies,
                   or ethnicity. It's an endless series of proxy battles fought
                   by mercenaries and machines. War - and its consumption of
                   life - has become a well-oiled machine.
 War has changed. ID-tagged soldiers carry ID-tagged weapons,
                   use ID-tagged gear. Nanomachines inside their bodies enhance
                   and regulate their abilities. Genetic control. Information
                   control. Emotion control. Battlefield control. Everything is
                   monitored and kept under control. 
 War has changed. The age of deterrence has become the age of
                   control... All in the name of averting catastrophe from
                   weapons of mass destruction. And he who controls the
                   battlefield... Controls history.
 Otacon. Even the dead have ears.
 Otacon... The test results...
 So?
 A year at best, right?
 It won't make any difference. I'm not an ordinary man to
                   begin with. Not to mention FOXDIE.
 Naomi...
 Colonel! Good to see you.
 I figured the only place I'd ever see you dressed like that
                   would be at your daughter's wedding. What are you doing
                   these days?
 I remember the resolution being passed a few years ago.
 This is Snake. Do you read me?
 I'm just inside the city limits. This place is crawling with
                   lizards.
 Unmanned... Pretty soon they'll have put living, breathing
                   soldiers out of work.
 You really think he's here...
 Mk.II?
 OK. Got it.
 Otacon?
 Metal Gear?
 Where are you?
 Wish I was good with gadgets.
 Looks like an eye patch.
 The rebels are out there.
 And this is their home turf.
 An Operator...
 How thoughtful.
 You coming?
 Got it.
 Who are you?
 You're not with the militia, and you're not PMC...
 Laundered?
 Drebin?
 There are more of you?
 Is the hider CQC compatible?
 Flip-up sight, rail system... Not bad.
 The frame's pretty rigid. No rattle.
 I can't pull the trigger.
 What's weird?
 Older generation?
 Seriously, who are you?
 What's your take on him, Otacon?
 How does he pull it off, anyway?
 You think the Patriots are involved somehow?
 Can he be trusted?
 All right.
 Like what?
 Boo.
 Looks like you're doing pretty well for yourself.
 What makes you think you know me?
 Otacon, you and Drebin both mentioned something about a war
                   price earlier. What did you mean by that?
 I see.
 Sounds good.
 Guess I'll have to rely on him for now.
 All right...
 Here.
 You haven't even taken the safety off, rookie.
 How the hell'd you ever survive 10 years?
 FOX...?
 Meryl?
 Accelerated aging. They don't know the cause.
 Meryl, you're my informant in the US military?
 First hounds, now rats.
 Here, you can have this back.
 What is your problem? You OK?
 Stomach pains?
 Diarrhea...
 So, you're the commander of this 01 unit?
 You're all grown up.
 Threat assessment - the PMCs.
 Well, that's some rumor. I'm only here because the UN wants
                   me to assess the impact and effects of PMCs on their refugee
                   protection efforts.
 More than enough for a retired vet like me.
 How can you be so sure?
 You've got these System nanomachines in you, too?
 Security guarantee?
 And the Patriots are behind this?
 Never mind. So this System is foolproof, huh?
 Sons of the Patriots...
 I just met a guy who said he could launder ID guns. The
                   System does have holes...
 By force, huh?
 Then... If you got caught...?
 Didn't the colonel tell you he was sending me?
 Yeah.
 You didn't know?
 Meryl!
 Meryl...
 So...you knew?
 Then... Why are you still calling him "uncle?"
 He's your father.
 Meryl!
 Really?
 No.
 Meryl, where's Liquid?
 Is that part of the System, too?
 I'm no hero. Never was, never will be.
 This get-up doubles as a muscle suit. I can still get
                   around.
 Thanks.
 Otacon, I know where Liquid is.
 I wonder how much that has to do with the System. The senses
                   you used to develop through extended training and experience
                   can now be obtained without even working for them. Seems
                   once you're under the System's control, you don't even need
                   experience at all. It even beats VR training that was all
                   the rage a few years back.
 Can the nanomachines do anything to counteract Post
                   Traumatic Stress Disorder?
 You think so? That geek kid, Akiba - he was really starting
                   to lose it.
 And that big guy - he didn't seem to be feeling any pain at
                   all.
 But a soldier's got to have more than that.
 It can't be...
 Isn't that...?
 Otacon, wait here.
 Liquid!
 That's the mission. Are you going to stop me?
 Understood.
 Liquid!
 Naomi?
 I don't remember the sun being so flat.
 Hey... None for me, Sunny.
 How long was I out?
 Someone saved my life.
 Liquid got away.
 My body...just seized up all of a sudden. This isn't normal.
                   It's not my joints or muscles.
 She was there... Naomi was at Liquid's side... Otacon, did
                   you see her?
 So it was Naomi.... Why?
 We grownups have to watch our caloric intake, you know. But
                   thank you...
 I was looking for this.
 Yeah? Why don't you teach her how to cook eggs, then?
 First generation?
 What the hell is that?
 Yeah, I hear they added that to my rap sheet, too.
 But there's no actual proof?
 Or it could be a trap.
 Colonel... Where's Meryl?
 Which leaves Naomi as our only lead.
 20 hours until we land. Got it. I'll have a look at the
                   documents. Maybe I'll even have a smoke while I still
                   can....
 Colonel, how deeply are they involved in all of this?
 The data we got from Arsenal Gear was a load of crap. Twelve
                   founders who've all been dead for a hundred years... Give me
                   a break. We know they exist today. If the purpose of this
                   battlefield control system is to control IDs, it fits in
                   with their plans perfectly.
 Everything that Solidus feared five years ago... It's all
                   come to pass.
 Then Liquid's insurrection is against them?
 You mean the PMCs and their war business.
 He must be dying to break free of their spell.
 And no matter who wins, the world has no future. Until we
                   stop Liquid and destroy the System, we'll never be free.
 That's where she is?
 What now?
 Meaning?
 Steer clear of altitude sickness. Got it.
 Vamp!
 Otacon, what the hell?
 Those were PMC soldiers with him. Is he involved in Liquid's
                   plan?
 Not a chance. This is the real world, not some fantasy game.
 Not now, Otacon!
 Mei Ling? What's she up to these days?
 The Missouri? That's a World War II battleship.
 No kidding.
 Even so, making captain at her age, that's pretty
                   impressive.
 Maybe it's too early to retire after all.
 No. At this point, I've got no need for any more training.
 That freak I just saw, with the tentacles, was it using the
                   same OctoCamo system as my suit?
 I thought that technology was of your own design.
 And the data came from?
 So in other words, we're on equal ground, technologically.
 And by the looks of things, they know I'm coming, too.
 Psychological counselor?
 She?
 Yeah. She was in charge of Jack's files, wasn't she?
 Yeah, I hear psychological counseling's the hot field these
                   days. Increased combat efficiency and productivity, all
                   without ever picking up a gun.
 I know. Mind, body, technique. Some things haven't changed
                   with time.
 By the way, Colonel, isn't that your house?
 Then the woman you married, the one that Meryl was talking
                   about.
 News to me. What about Jack?
 Jack. From FOXHOUND. Codename Raiden. I seem to remember him
                   being engaged to Rose.
 Jack's gone? I used to work with the guy. He saved Sunny
                   from the Patriots.
 What about you? Jack disappeared, and you just moved in on
                   Rose?
 She's young enough to be your daughter.
 Now I see why Meryl was so disgusted.
 Yeah, I believe her words were, "I'll never forgive that
                   womanizing piece of shit."
 Colonel, you knew she was our informant in the Middle East,
                   didn't you? Was it you who put her up to it?
 You wanted your daughter someplace where you could keep an
                   eye on her.
 Since Shadow Moses, I've been branded a criminal.
 Who is this?
 That voice.
 Is this...Jack?
 Wait!
 You....
 You've been following me?
 B&Bs?
 That's a female?
 Old, huh?
 War transforms us....
 Mantis...?
 Octopus, Raven, Wolf, Mantis...
 Drebin...
 I thought no one was supposed to be able to hack into the
                   System. Are you with the Patriots?
 You can say "Patriot." I guess that means you're clean,
                   right?
 What the hell are these Patriots? Are they human?
 A life of its own?
 What if, hypothetically, someone found a way?
 Haven?
 But Liquid's got something in mind. You sure there's no way?
 This is Jack, isn't it?
 Where are you now?
 Raiden, where have you been all this time? What have you
                   been doing?
 Finding what?
 What?
 Liquid?
 Matka Pluku... Big Mama.
 Wait! What about Big Boss's body?
 Her?
 Rose, I just got a call from Raiden. It sounds like he's
                   close by.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, as far as I could tell from his voice.
 What?
 What happened between you and Jack?
 All right. I'll keep my mouth shut.
 Naomi?
 Naomi.
 Nine.
 Why?
 Otacon's fine. He's the same as ever.
 Who were you just talking to?
 I thought he was here.
 Where are all the guards?
 Naomi... What happened in the Middle East?
 Another product of the System?
 I'm not sure yet.
 Let's hear it first.
 Does this have something to do with that test of yours?
 And the nanomachines went berserk?
 Frank Jaeger... Grey Fox.
 But what about me? I've never been under the System's
                   control.
 All right, let's just get this over with.
 The ones you stuck me with at Moses?
 So does the aging have something to do with FOXDIE, too?
 Why?
 The truth, Naomi. How long is my body going to hold out?
 How long do I have?
 Now what?
 What do you mean?
 Yeah, so?
 I know. That's what killed the AT president... And Liquid.
 Meaning?
 What if we kill them all - remove them from the body?
 Half a year.
 Three months!
 It's not over yet.
 And if I choose death first...? Will that stop FOXDIE from
                   spreading?
 Yeah.
 Don't they always?
 Him!
 What's in it?
 You said yourself we mustn't allow ourselves to be chained
                   to fate.
 Then I'll free us both. Where's Liquid?
 Do you even know?
 Where was he headed?
 What are you talking about?
 Guns of the Patriots...
 OctoCamo....
 Drebin. What do you want?
 FaceCamo?
 Doesn't fit. It's not my size or shape.
 Somebody's done either homework.
 Is that the real reason you injected me with those
                   nanomachines? To spy on me?
 Drebin...
 Then what'd you mix a virus in with the nanomachines for?
 A certain virus was detected in my body. Are you saying it
                   wasn't in the nanomachines you injected?
 Something in her past?
 Why are you telling me this? You expect me to feel sorry for
                   her?
 What was?
 I'm not like Big Boss. Tracking isn't my strongest suit.
                   When did you get so good at it?
 Drifted? You never went back to see Rose?
 Awareness?
 You sound like a ninja.
 Switch the Solid Eye to infrared (NV). Got it.
 All right.
 I'll give it a shot.
 So if I'm wearing the Solid Eye and get too close, it'll
                   give my postion away.
 Otacon, it's Vamp. I'm sure of it.
 Drebin!
 Naomi! Jump!
 Can you walk?
 Come on, Naomi, stay with me.
 Up you go.
 You OK?
 Raiden.
 Can you move?
 Naomi, go on ahead.
 Naomi, take care of this.
 Otacon, get us out of here!
 Still fighting.
 Raiden!
 Raiden! You OK?
 Raiden!
 What do you mean?
 Does your body have the same nanomachines?
 Can you save him?
 Raiden!
 What's the need for the original if a substitute works just
                   as well?
 What do you mean we don't match?
 So that's what Liquid was talking about?
 But Solidus is dead.
 So when Liquid accessed the System in the Middle East and
                   South America... It was only a test.
 Hold on. I thought having his code wasn't enough. You need
                   his biometric data at the same time, don't you?
 Big Boss is... Alive?
 That's impossible!
 Europe, huh?
 Allowing him total control of the System.
 Where'd you hack this from?
 Where? The same place Liquid went?
 Well, I'm gonna be spewing out poison soon enough anyway.
                   What's one more smoke gonna hurt?
 Which means that Liquid's lurking somewhere behind the
                   scenes.
 The PMC's sure seem to know you well enough.
 You alone?
 What is wrong with that guy?
 You're planning to take him by force? That's crazy. Look...
                   Things aren't that simple.
 It's gonna be the Middle East all over again.
 I wouldn't rely too much on the System if I were you.
 Meryl--
 I know. It's not justice. It's a hired hit.
 Don't worry about me. Old soldiers never die.
 I'm no hero... Never was. I'm just an old killer... Hired to
                   do some wet work.
 Otacon, they've seen this face, too.
 And Meryl was acting kind of strange.
 Yeah, I thought it looked a little too quiet to be a tourist
                   attraction.
 But how exactly am I supposed to find this resistance?
 Intercept their communications? How do I do that?
 Got it.
 Really?
 They'll be all right on their own?
 Good.
 I got it.
 I'm here to see Big Mama.
 I need to talk to you. Raiden sent me.
 What?
 You mean... A surrogate mother?
 Gave... Birth?
 "Zero?"
 Founder? When did this happen?
 You?
 Snake?
 The Boss?
 GW? The same GW we destroyed five years ago?
 Sounds almost like a religion.
 The Shadow Moses Incident....
 Raiden....
 Why did Zero keep him alive?
 Liquid is after Big Boss's body. Is it here?
 Otacon...
 What happpened?
 When?
 Why weren't you watching her?
 Naomi said it herself - the experiment can't succeed without
                   her.
 What about Raiden?
 Will he live?
 What the hell is that?
 You sure about this?
 Big Mama....
 Are you OK!?
 Are you OK? Big Mama, come on... Stay with me.
 Big Mama!
 Over there.
 I'll take care of it. You stay here - keep watch.
 Here. Take this.
 I will.
 Drebin...
 Not much use to me without an ID, though.
 What's the catch?
 How old was she?
 Soldiers?
 Anonymous violence.
 It was her strength - and her greatest weakness.
 Drebin...
 Good thinking.
 Yeah.
 Liquid!
 Is that it...?
 Naomi.
 You think you're Big Boss now?
 Even if you do get a hold of the System, you'll only have
                   one part of the Patriots' AI... The military part.
 Impossible! We destroyed it!
 Liquid, you're planning to recreate the Patriots?
 Meryl!
 Liquid! Stop!
 Otacon!
 You.
 Haven... Yeah... Drebin was saying something about that.
 GW... I knew I'd heard that name before.
 A haven on the network... Free from oversight by the
                   Patriots' AIs.
 Where is this haven? Where is their base?
 But that's not all Liquid said... Something about REX being
                   ready.
 The information's gonna be controlled anyway.
 They must be shitting themselves at the White House right
                   about now.
 But Liquid only controls SOP, the SOP only controls guns and
                   small firearms. Unless he gains supreme authority, Liquid
                   can't use America's nukes and ballistic missiles... So how's
                   he gonna launch this strike?
 If Liquid can't use the nukes... Then what's his plan?
 What?
 Of course... The rail gun.
 Shadow Moses Island.
 I'm not dead yet.
 Otacon...!
 It's not about winning or losing. I... No, we started this.
                   And it's our duty to finish it.
 Sunny...
 Raiden....
 I'm a shadow. One that no light will shine on. As long as
                   you follow me, you'll never see the day.
 Raiden....
 Raiden... Five years ago... That's not what I meant.
 Don't be an idiot. You know you've got someone to protect.
 You've got it all wrong. You were the lightning in that
                   rain. You can still shine through the darkness.
 Raiden... Look at me.
 Do you see this?
 I have no future. In a few months, I'm going to be a weapon
                   of mass destruction. You... You have a family.
 Raiden....
 This is my fight. My destiny.
 Liquid's arrival there can only mean one thing...
 I was having that dream again.
 Yeah. I just slipped a little. Have to hurry... Not much
                   time left.
 Who, me? Never.
 A surveillance camera?
 Otacon, last time around we had a few complications and
                   wound up going through the commander's office in the
                   basement.
 Good point.
 How do I open it?
 I'm not senile yet.
 I told you, I'm not senile... Yet.
 The switchboard - nailed it with a remote-control missile to
                   shut down the electric current in the floor. The guidance
                   system in those things takes up so much space it hardly
                   leaves any room for explosives.
 Hardly. Switchboard's still intact.
 Wait a minute... I'm not going to get shocked if I walk on
                   this floor, am I?
 Yep.
 Yeah... I remember.
 Naomi hated them for what they did to Frank's body... But it
                   was me that crippled him in the first place. She must have
                   hated me, too.
 So what? What did she do to us?
 No. If that was all, it should have been over and done with
                   in South America. Why'd she join us afterward?
 She has us come rescue her and then she turns around goes
                   straight back to Liquid. Why would she do that?
 What?
 Naomi.
 The beauty and the beast.
 Amazing. Almost makes me nostalgic for the days when you
                   needed a keycard for every door.
 Thanks.
 I won't.
 No.
 Damn it, Otacon, get a grip!
 Otacon, how do I get this door open?
 We should have been able to get to REX's storage hangar from
                   here.
 How do I get there?
 Northwest corner - got it.
 What about her?
 To kill me? Is that all you cared about?
 Gray Fox?
 But I can't go yet. I still have a job to do.
 Damn it! Has it already been shipped?
 Naomi!
 We've been had... Otacon!
 Hurry!
 Naomi!
 There... Now you're a mere mortal - like the rest of us.
 Gekko!
 You ready for this?
 Otacon, we're gonna buy you some time.
 REX!
 Ark?
 Outer Haven...?
 What have you done?
 Then you...
 Otacon!
 Otacon!
 That's right. We need you.
 Any ideas?
 I'm listening!
 Raiden!
 Liquid!
 FOX...
 Liquid!
 Raiden!
 No!
 Raiden... Raiden...
 Liquid's very own Death Star...
 A giant microwave oven. You'd have to have a death wish to
                   go in there. Sounds like the perfect job for me.
 Where are you getting all this information? You really think
                   there's a way to destroy GW?
 Naomi?
 What do you mean?
 Whose side was she on, anyway?
 Anybody got a smoke?
 So this program... You're saying Sunny wrote it?
 Why? It's not like I've got my health to worry about.
 I still have things left to do... Besides smoke.
 Otacon. Why don't you jump off the ship with me?
 Raiden... How is he?
 Right.
 The only people I have left to rely on are Meryl and... Him.
 What are you doing here?
 Drebin, do you have even the slightest idea what's going on
                   here?
 It is. I'm all out.
 All right.
 Hey... Here.
 Right.
 Where are you?
 Can you walk?
 Are you OK?
 Makes you feel alive, doesn't it? What about Akiba?
 Meryl!
 Otacon.
 Sounds like the perfect job for me.
 Meryl!
 Meryl...?
 It can't be...
 Meryl, don't...!
 Wait! Akiba!
 You... Psycho Mantis...?
 Psycho Mantis?
 What the hell are you talking about?
 The last of the Beasts.
 Meryl!
 Meryl....
 Yeah... No way I'm getting through there uncooked.
 I... I'm sorry you got dragged into this.
 It's not about winning or losing.
 And it's our duty to finish it.
 You were the lightning in that rain. You can still shine
                   through the darkness.
 I'm... Sorry you got dragged into this...
 Otacon... The shots... They're not working.
 Raiden....
 The corridor's full of microwaves. One of us is enough.
 Your body may be a machine... But your heart is human.
                   You've got a life to go back to.
 Raiden, look at me. You still have your youth. Don't waste
                   it. You can start over. From here on, this is my fight. I...
                   We tore the world apart... Made your life a living hell.
 It's my duty to put an end to all of this.
 Otacon... Lock it from the inside.
 Otacon... Can you do it?
 Otacon!
 Otacon, what is it?
 Why? You could have stopped us?
 Liquid!
 War has changed. Our time has ended. Our war is over. But
                   there's one more thing I must do... One last punishment I
                   must endure. Erase my genes... Wipe this meme from the face
                   of the earth. This... Is my final mission.
 Big Boss?
 What?
 How can you still be alive?
 What do you mean without shape or form?
 You going back to zero, as well?
 What are you talking about?
 What's wrong?
 Does that mean the mutant strain won't cause an epidemic?
 Am I going to die?
 No thanks. I'm quitting.
 These things will kill ya.
 No. There's one thing I still have to do. I have to see this
                   age off... See what the future brings.
 Otacon, I'm gonna be dead soon. You don't have to come.
 I know... A blue rose. There won't be any happy "Beauty and
                   the Beast" ending for me. What little time I have left will
                   be spent living... As a beast. A shadow of the inside... Of
                   the old age.
 A witness?
 Otacon....

  War has changed. When the battlefield is under total
                   control... ...War becomes routine.
